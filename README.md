# Image Processing Toolkit

## Description

This Image Processing Toolkit provides a versatile set of tools for resizing and converting images. It supports a range of formats and offers two resizing methods: stretch and crop. Whether you're preparing images for a web project, optimizing assets for a game, or simply converting images for compatibility, this toolkit offers a straightforward CLI interface to accomplish your tasks efficiently.

## Dependencies

This project depends on the Python Imaging Library (PIL), specifically the `Pillow` fork, to handle image processing tasks. Ensure you have Python installed on your system, and then install Pillow using pip:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Usage

First, clone this repository to your local machine using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fairy-root/image-processing
cd image-processing
```

To use the toolkit, run the script from your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python image_processing.py
```

### Image Resizer

When prompted, choose option `1` for image resizing. You will then select a mode (`1` for Stretch or `2` for Crop) and specify the desired dimensions (width and height in pixels).

### Image Converter

For image conversion, choose option `2`. Enter the desired output format when prompted (supported formats include ICO, JPEG, BMP, GIF, PNG, WEBP).

## Supported Formats

Input formats:
- PNG
- JPEG
- BMP
- GIF
- WEBP

Output formats:
- ICO
- JPEG
- BMP
- GIF
- PNG
- WEBP

Please ensure that your images are located in the same directory as the script, or modify the script to target the specific directory containing your images.
